# hello-world
my first repository :)
I just want to say that all of this is very, very new to me, so please forgive me if I do something completely bone-headed!

I'm an old engineer with very little knowledge of programming - I flagged (got an F in) my first and only computer course in 1983 in my freshman year at Georgia Tech. That was Fortran '77, and I had *no idea* what I was doing.  The mainframe terminal I had to use was missing keys, and I had never even turned on a computer before that class (PC's were new then and I had never ever used one).

But, I'm trying to learn now, so please bear with me.
