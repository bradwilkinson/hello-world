				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I am building an airplane.&nbsp; Most people think this is a crazy idea, and when I mention it to someone, or it somehow comes up in conversation, the usual response is, “You mean a REAL airplane??!!”<br>
Yeah – I mean a real airplane, one with four seats and 70 gallons of fuel and a baggage area big enough for your stuff.&nbsp; A go-anywhere airplane.&nbsp; It has a big cargo door on the side because the guy who designed it rebuilds airplane engines and transports them in the prototype of this airplane – the Bearhawk.&nbsp; My Bearhawk building log website is <a href="http://www.mykitlog.com/users/index.php?user=bwilkinson&project=502" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp; I met this man, Bob Barrows, at the Sun ‘n’ Fun fly-in back in 1996.&nbsp; He had just finished the original prototype not long before that, and he had it there on display. Bob is an inspiration to me – a mechanical engineer like myself, and a man who set out to design and build his own airplane because he wanted to – and did, very successfully, too.&nbsp; And I fell in love with his airplane.&nbsp; It’s not sexy and sleek and ultra fast – it’s more like a pick-up truck or a sport-utility vehicle like the original Bronco. A utility aircraft, but fast enough to get you where you want to go, and versatile enough to land in just about any field, paved or not. Try that with your plastic Lancair IV-P.&nbsp; I never wanted to be an airline pilot. Or a bus driver for that matter.<br>
But – like my dad told me when I was a kid: “You can’t afford an airplane – they are for rich people”, I don’t exactly have the money to just go out and pay for the things I need to finish the airplane.&nbsp; And I HATE debt, almost as badly as Dave Ramsey does. I’m pretty sure that I entirely bit off more than I could chew when it came to picking an airplane.&nbsp; I probably should have gotten something smaller, maybe one or two seats and little or no baggage.&nbsp; Then I could have an airplane very inexpensively, and maybe even afford to go fly it some.&nbsp; But my desire to have one airplane to do everything I wanted won out.&nbsp; So even though I used home equity to buy the quick-build kit for the Bearhawk, instead of cutting and welding chrome-moly tubing and hammering our aluminum wing ribs for 5 years, I don’t really want to go into debt to get a used aircraft engine for $20,000. I really don’t like the idea of paying $40,000+ for a new one, either.<br>
So I am looking at alternatives.&nbsp; I started out by looking for used airplane engines on the web, and even those are still in the $10,000+/- range depending on their state of being worn out.&nbsp; My idea was to find one and rebuild it myself.&nbsp; I have the ability, but not necessarily the tools or all of the information.&nbsp; Aircraft engines, being regulated by the federal government, are covered in red tape.&nbsp; All of the specifications and instruction manuals are covered in it, too.&nbsp; So although the information is available, it is very complex with updates and revisions and red tape documentation.&nbsp; Scares me to think about trying to figure out if I have the right part for my engine.<br>
One alternative, in fact they are considered ‘alternative engines’ in the aviation world, is an automotive engine. Auto engines are plentiful and fairly inexpensive.&nbsp; You can buy a new one in the crate, even a performance one, for $5000. No rebuilding necessary.&nbsp; They are relatively inexpensive compared to an aircraft engine, because they are literally made in the millions. Aircraft engines are made in the 1000′s or less – really.&nbsp; Ford Motor Company, General Motors Company and Toyota Motor Corporation don’t have the word ‘motor’ in their name because they build cars – nope, they build motors, millions of them.&nbsp; And they are used in everything from sewage pumps to luxury sedans.&nbsp; Auto engines are in a fairly high state of evolution.&nbsp; The technology and the quality that goes into these really is at an awesome level these days.<br>
In the aviation world, ‘experts’ and ‘pilots’ look at the idea of installing an auto engine in an airplane as some kind of fringe, wacko, hippie, cult-ish idea that is unacceptable to their structured and regulated aviation world.&nbsp; It is not an ‘Aircraft Engine’, so it’s not good enough.&nbsp; I hear them say things like, “aircraft engines are <em>designed</em> and <em>engineered</em> for aircraft – auto engines are not”.&nbsp; Well, technically, they are right – but, technically, most of these people don’t have the first clue what ‘design’ and ‘engineering’ mean.&nbsp; They just spout it out because they’ve heard it before.&nbsp; I like to call this sort of thing “regurgitating the mantra”. They are against the idea and will continue to regurgitate their semi-religious ‘aviation’ viewpoints forever, whether they actually understand or not. And whether they do understand them is questionable.&nbsp; Not exactly what I would call open-minded.&nbsp; And they conveniently forget that almost all the aircraft companies they like began their existence around airplanes that had auto engines in them – because that’s all there was at the time (1920′s and 30′s).<br>
The biggest reason for this viewpoint, I think, is that there have been many failed and otherwise unsuccessful auto engine installations.&nbsp; This is also because of the lack of design and engineering understanding on the part of the people who have failed.&nbsp; I saw an airplane in EAA’s <em>Sport Aviation</em> magazine years ago where the man had copied and replicated an old pre-WWII biplane, and prided himself on the fact that he used an off-the-shelf small block chevy engine and just bolted the prop onto an extension on the flywheel of the engine – just like the original. OH NO!!&nbsp; I’ve never heard if there was ever any problem with that installation – but it scares me.&nbsp; Talking about not being ‘designed and engineered’ – this is definitely a case of that.&nbsp; Bolting the prop to the crank was probably not a bad idea back when engines were built much heavier (Ford Model A), much slower, and less powerful.&nbsp; Not a bad idea because these engines were ‘engineered’ for the occasional use on the farm for belt-driven pumps and such – so they had heavy crank extensions.&nbsp; The props were wooden, and the engines put out about 30 or 40 horsepower, in a homebuilt wooden and fabric airplane that flew 75 mph top speed – so not a highly stressed installation. But the crank in a modern auto engine is certainly not ‘designed or engineered’ for the thrust, gyroscopic forces, bending moments or other dynamic effects that a propeller imparts to a shaft.&nbsp; Aircraft engines have a special part of the front of the crankshaft that <em>is</em> designed for this – it’s a journal (oil film) bearing that is about 4 inches long and 2 inches in diameter, with a thrust bearing surface at the rear.&nbsp; And the aircraft engine crankshaft itself <em>is</em> designed to withstand the forces that a propeller generates. So there is a bit of a design challenge here in making an auto engine work safely and effectively while driving a propeller, and this is rarely done well if at all. Therefore, the idea is seen as ‘fringe engineering’ – and rightfully so.<br>
The other two mantras I hear regurgitated often are, “auto engines have to <em>‘rev high’</em> to make horsepower, aircraft engines don’t”, and the equally-misconceived “auto engines can’t operate with a wide-open throttle at high power for a long time – aircraft engines can”.&nbsp; Well these are common and entirely erroneous aviation mantras, and I could write a small book about this misconception.&nbsp; Auto engines don’t <em>have to</em> rev high, but they <em>can</em>. The fact is, auto engines are designed and engineered to operate over a wide range of rpm and power output, and use a transmission to lower the output speed for the wheels (cars’ wheels only turn about 600-900 rpm at 60 mph, depending on size). Most auto engines are capable of turning 5000 – 6000 rpm, and do during wide-open acceleration.&nbsp; But they usually don’t spend a lot of time there.&nbsp; The ones that can spend more time there have forged steel cranks and connecting rods, 4-bolt main bearing caps and valve springs and camshaft profiles that are designed to operate at higher rpm and under heavy loads for longer times than normal.&nbsp; Typically, cars don’t operate continuously in a high-output condition, but they can – especially trucks.&nbsp; Anyone who has driven a 3/4-ton pick-up pulling a trailer with a large boat or tractor on it out on the highway at 60 mph will tell you that the engine in the truck is operating at a high rpm and high power output for a long period of time. Truck engines are designed for high-output for a long time because of this – like an aircraft engine.&nbsp; Have you ever heard anyone who has done this talk about how much gasoline they used? “Man, that thing just drank the gas!’&nbsp; Yeah, I bet it did, because it takes a large amount of power to haul something big (aerodynamic drag) and heavy (inertia) at highway speeds and up hills.&nbsp; A high fuel consumption means a high power output in an otherwise normal engine, and usually means high rpm, too.<br>
Oh yeah – don’t even get me started on the ‘wide-open throttle’ thing – it simply ain’t true, aircraft engines have a high-speed throttle stop built into the throttle control system that is adjusted to give a <em>maximum static rpm</em> while on the ground.&nbsp; This is based on the maximum design rpm. If they didn’t have this throttle stop and were actually operated at real wide-open throttle, they would sling themselves (and the prop) apart in short order – just like any other Otto-cycle engine would.&nbsp; It would just occur at a much lower rpm than an auto engine, because aircraft engines are <em>not</em> designed for high rpm.&nbsp; A propeller’s pitch limits the maximum rpm, too – by giving the engine all the bite it can stand within it’s safe rpm range, and maximizing the useful thrust.&nbsp; As the airplane climbs, the air gets thinner and the engine can speed up because the propeller sees less resistance, but it is also faced with thinner air which makes less power in the engine, so even ‘wide-open’ the power delivered to the prop is less and the engine simply can’t really turn much faster. If it could it is still limited by the maximum design rpm, which is really optimized for the propeller, and the static maximum is set for safety.&nbsp; So aircraft engines just don’t operate at wide-open.&nbsp; There is a maximum rpm that can be developed by any given engine and propeller if the maximum design rpm is ignored, it’s where the power output matches the resistance provided by propeller, but I have no idea how high this rpm could be on a typical engine with a typical prop if you ignored the static rpm setting. Aircraft engines are just too expensive to play around with this.&nbsp; If you put a really long pitch propeller on an engine, the maximum rpm could be be reduced to where the engine is giving all the power it can at a speed below it’s design maximum, but this isn’t usually done because you want the engine to operate in a safe, dependable rpm zone and deliver all it can efficiently.<br>
Aircraft engines, because they are designed to be as lightweight as possible for a given power output, are large cubic inch engines that drive the propeller directly at a relatively slow and mostly constant speed. So they do make their power at a low rpm, and are only designed to turn the maximum rpm that a propeller can turn and still be efficient – without the extra weight of a transmission.&nbsp; This means around 3000 rpm or less, any faster and the propeller tips can approach sonic speeds where compressibility of the air becomes a problem for the propeller’s ability to make any more thrust.&nbsp; So you want your propeller to turn slower and have a big bite to make thrust and be somewhat efficient. Since you are driving the prop directly with the engine to save the weight of a transmission, the engine only needs to turn that fast (or slow).&nbsp; To make ‘high’ horsepower at low rpm means one thing – cubic inches.&nbsp; Because horsepower is simply torque over time (with a revolutions adjustment factored in because engine shafts go in a circle and don’t really go anywhere). Moving 550 lbs one foot in one second is one horsepower, thank you Mr. Watt, and when it’s torque on a shaft you need correct this for rotary motion by using ‘pi’ to put it on a revolutions basis, and adjust revolutions-per-minute into seconds. So you end up with hp = (torque x rpm / 5252).&nbsp; For a given rpm, more torque is more horsepower.&nbsp; You may have heard the drag-racing saying “there’s no substitute for cubic inches” – because it’s true.&nbsp; More cubic inches make more torque because there’s more force put on a bigger piston by an equivalent combustion pressure.&nbsp; Airplane engines typically have a large 5″ piston and a 4″ stroke for this reason.&nbsp; BUT – <em>news flash</em>: A large cubic inch automotive engine, turning at 3000 rpm will make the about same horsepower as an aircraft engine of the same displacement at that speed.&nbsp; An ‘old-technology’ 350 Chevrolet small-block auto engine new in the crate from <a href="http://www.gmperformanceparts.com/EngineShowcase/dynochart.jsp?engId=350HO&engine=350%20HO&sku=12499711&engCat=sb" target="_blank">GM Performance</a> makes about 200 hp at 2750 rpm, and peaks at 330 hp at 5000 rpm – for about $4000.&nbsp; An O-360-A1A aircraft engine new in the crate from <a href="http://www.lycoming.com/engines/series/pdfs/360ci%20Engine%20Insert.pdf" target="_blank">Lycoming</a> makes 180 hp at 2700 rpm, maximum – for about $43,000.&nbsp; You can get a fuel-injected IO-360-A1A with angle-valve heads, tuned induction and slightly higher compression that makes 200 hp at 2700 rpm, maximum – for about $54,000.&nbsp; This is one of the engines my airplane is designed to use. So you can see why bolting the prop directly to an auto engine is appealing to some of the ‘fringers’ – it makes the same horsepower at the same rpm – for a LOT less money. So auto engines<em> don’t have to ‘</em>rev high’ to make horsepower, but when they do they make more than an aircraft engine!<br>
More to come…</p>

			<p>My primary reason for doing this blog is to get things off my mind.&nbsp; I have thousands of ideas racing around in my head all the time, and I need a little relief.&nbsp; Since I tend to think about physical things like machines and the cosmos, and these things are not ‘emotionally charged’ and dangerous, this format is more useful to me than a diary would be.&nbsp; I don’t think about the things you put in a diary very much, so one little 100 page diary would probably last me a lifetime – and still be mostly empty.&nbsp; This is not a good thing I know, and it’s probably because the things that would go in a diary are just buried somewhere in my psyche – but hay, I’m working on that too.&nbsp; You just won’t see it here.<br>
What you’ll see here are my thoughts and ideas on little things like engines, aircraft, boats, cars, spacecraft and the design of these things, as well as on things like computers, robots, technology, physics and science.&nbsp; And, occasionally, there may some scattered remarks about politics, religion or philosophy – but those things only interest me in the sense that I think they are flawed and I have a better idea – of course.</p>
